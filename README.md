# Student-Alcohol-Consumption

In this project, we used a data set about Portuguese student on two
courses
(Mathematics and Portuguese) which was collected in University of
Minho, Portugal. Our work intends to approach student addiction
on alcohol in secondary level using Python. The result shows that a
good predictive accuracy can be achieved, provided that addiction of
alcohol can impact to the student performance. In addition, the result
also provides the correlation between alcohol usage and the social,
gender and study time attributes for each student. As a direct outcome
of our project, more efficient solutions can be developed in order to pay
more attention to the student and share how the alcohol impact so badly
in their life.
The database was built from two sources: school reports, based on
paper sheets and including few attributes and questionnaires, used to
complement the previous information.
The data was integrated into two data-sets related to Mathematics (with
395 examples) and the Portuguese language (649 records) classes.
During the preprocessing stage, some features were discarded due to
the lack of discriminative value. For instance, few respondents did not
answered about their family income (probably due to privacy
issues), while almost 100 % of the students live with their parents and
have a personal computer at home.

“With the help of this dataset we predict the
Students ' grades according to the available
data.”
